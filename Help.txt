                                        *====================*                                        
                    Rubiko is a puzzle game based on the original 3x3 Rubik's cube.                   
                            The six sides are represented in a grid view.                             
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      
                                                  -----                                               
                                                  | B |                                               
                                          -----------------                                           
                                          | F | E | A | C |                                           
                                          -----------------                                           
                                                  | D |                                               
                                                  -----                                               
                                                                                                      
                     On the main menu you have a couple of options to start a game.                   
            If you want to play a brand new randomly generated cube simply press Let's Play.       
        If you want to continue a game you saved before go to Load game, then press Let's Play.  
                                                                                                 
                        Now that you have started the game you see the grid.                    
                      Your job is to get every side filled with the same number.                 
                                                                                                 
                    To do this you tell the game what has to be moved and where.                 
                                                                                                 
                                        You first choose a side.                                 
                        Your options are: A, B, C, D, E, F and a, b, c, d, e, f.                 
                                                                                                 
                       Your second choice is which colomn or row needs to be moved.              
                                            1, 2, 3 are colomns.                                  
                                            4, 5, 6 are rows.                                    
       If you choose colomn, you next tell the program if you want to move it up or down, 1 or    
        If you choose row, you next tell the game if you want to move it left or right, 1 or 2    
                                                                                                  
                                          This counts as one move.                                
                                                                                                  
                     Every move will effect the other side like a real Rubik's cube,             
                       so your job is to realise how every side effects the others.              
                                                                                                 
               If at any time during a move you wish to open the menu you simply enter M,        
                              at the end of the turn the Menu will pop up.                       
                                                                                                 
              There you can Save your game, Load another one, open up these Instructions or      
                                       take a look at the Score Board.                           
                                                                                                 
                      In the Load Game options you have the FinishedCube save file               
                            and the NewCube save file which are for training.                    
                           One is a completed cube with only one missing move,                   
                            one is a set random cube that you can practice on.
